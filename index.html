Epstein died while Trump was in office. Who stood to gain the most from his death? According to FAA flight logs, Trump flew on Epstein’s private jet at least seven times. In a 2002 New York Magazine interview, Trump said: “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”<br><br>
At the time, both men lived in Palm Beach, less than a 10-minute drive from each other. They attended the same social events, and Epstein was a regular at Mar-a-Lago.<br><br>
In 1994, a woman named Katie Johnson filed a federal lawsuit (case 1:16-cv-07673) alleging that both Epstein and Trump raped her when she was 13 years old at Epstein’s Manhattan home. The suit included sworn affidavits and was dropped just before the 2016 election, reportedly due to death threats. To verify: search “Katie Johnson Trump Epstein lawsuit.”<br><br>
Michael Wolff, journalist and author, recorded over 100 hours of interviews with Epstein. According to Wolff, Epstein described Trump as one of his “closest friends.” Trump operated the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants for years. Multiple former contestants have gone on record stating that Trump walked into dressing rooms while they were changing, some as young as 15. Trump confirmed this in a 2005 Howard Stern interview.<br><br>
Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s primary accusers, stated she was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago while working there at age 16. Maxwell, later convicted of trafficking minors, was photographed at multiple events with Trump and Melania. When Maxwell was arrested in 2020, Trump publicly said: “I wish her well.”<br><br>
Trump’s inner circle included Alan Dershowitz, another Epstein associate who has been accused by Giuffre and served on Trump’s legal team during his first impeachment. Then there’s the Epstein plea deal in 2008, secretly arranged by U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta—who later became Trump’s Labor Secretary and resigned under pressure in 2019 when the deal became public.<br><br>
Finally, in 2024, Trump’s campaign used Epstein’s former Gulfstream G550 jet for travel—a fact confirmed by aviation records and campaign filings.
